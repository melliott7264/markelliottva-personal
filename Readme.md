# Mark Elliott's Personal Website Rebuild (markelliottva.com)

## Description

This is a rebuild of Mark Elliott's personal web site created using WordPress and Elementor. Want to remove the Elementor and create a new child theme for the site. This site is to represent a transition from Mark Elliott's traditional crafts work as a business to a hobby. This site is to be a portfolio of Mark's best crafts work. As Elementor touched an a lot of the photographs making theme unusable in a site without Elementor, many of the pages and posts will have to be created. This project is an opportunity to get some experience in creating WordPress child themes in furtherance of Mark's new career as a web developer.
